Facet Browser for jQuery using PHP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
5th December 2013

This package contains the jQuery facet browser plugin and
a server-side script in PHP for resolving the facets.

TO VIEW THE DEMO:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The demo uses an sqlite database which is not included in
this package simply for size efficiency. Download the SQLite
database from here:

	http://david.dupplaw.me.uk/files/CarInfo.sqlite

Put this file into the same directory as you've extracted
this package to. It's a 1.8Mb download.

Next you need to include a couple of dependencies for the PHP
part. The dependencies are managed using composer, so download
and run composer:

	# Install Composer
	curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
	# Run Composer
	php composer.phar install

If you unpacked to a web-directory, you're done. Just go to
index.html. Otherwise, you can use PHP5's built-in web-server
to see the demo:

	php -S localhost:8000

Then browse to http://localhost:8000
